    Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree.
It was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife...
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day 
for more fruits as he loved them. The days passed by and the crocodile and the monkey became good 
friends. 
    One day the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife. She at the fruits and liked 
    them but ws jealous as she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey.
She told her husband,"The fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would
be. Get me the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but 
had no choice.
